Your desire to not modify t is expressed in const T& t. The ending const specifies that you
will not modify any member variables of the class abs belongs to. Since there is no class 
where this function belongs to, you get an error
 
The const modifier at the end of the function declaration applies to the hidden
this parameter for member functions.
