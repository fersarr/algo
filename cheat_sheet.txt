DIFF


This example will do what you need :

diff --side-by-side --suppress-common-lines FILE_A FILE_B

And if you use it often you can make a personalized alias for it.

alias diffs='diff --side-by-side --suppress-common-lines'

---
sort descending
std::greater<int>()
std::sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), std::greater<int>());

------
string s;
while(getline(cin, s, '\t')){
    // Do something with the line
}
If the delimiter is found, it is extracted and discarded, i.e. it is not stored and the next input operation will begin after it.

-----

cin.ignore(1)
cin.ignore(256,EOF)
cin.ignore(10,'\n')

if using cin and getline, remember that CIN does NOT consume \n
